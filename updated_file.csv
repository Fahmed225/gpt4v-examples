The images that include text and graphics appear to be informative in nature, likely discussing company values, statistics, or descriptions of services or areas of expertise. Notably, one image features what looks like products such as a green smoothie bottle, presumably protein powder with a measuring scoop, pasta, a muffin, and some sort of seed or pill-like items. These could be associated with the types of supplements or health-related products the company sells or incorporates into their offerings. However, based on the images provided, I cannot extract specific names of supplements for a JSON response.

The remaining images feature natural settings, such as individuals working with plants, which could imply a focus on botanicals or natural ingredient sourcing for the company's products.

Unfortunately, without text clearly defining the products or supplements offered by this company, it's not possible to provide you with a JSON array of supplement names. Hence, the JSON response, as per your instruction, is an empty array:
